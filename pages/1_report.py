    "1. **Root causing:** Answering the _'what'_ and _'where'_ of waste miscategorization.\n" +

st.markdown("Multi-index barplots help compare multiple waste types on the same axis. It becomes easy to categorize different substreams as theyâ€™re grouped into the same group and it becomes easy to compare multiple substreams that are on different waste types (since each bar is on the same axis).")

st.markdown("Adding upon all the pros of a multi-index bar plot, a stacked multi index bar plot adds another dimension of comparison by representing the different categories that make up the bar."

            "* Understanding magniture of these different categories. As each block is sized based on the weight that the block holds (eg. Benson Center block is relatively lareger sized than Learning Commons because former has more weight of waste collected), it becomes easy to visually compare and contrast them.\n" + 
            "* Hierarcy: As each block encompases multiple other blocks, this visual gives a notion of an implict hierarchy that exists. Eg:\n\t* Each building (holds) -> Multiple wast types\n\t* Each waste type within (holds) -> Multiple waste substreams"
